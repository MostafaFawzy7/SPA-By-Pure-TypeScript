# My First TypeScript App

> Hi all, this is My First TypeScript App, it's a single page app with pure TypeScript without React or any JS frameworks!

In this repo you can find the Implementation of Server-Side & Client-Side.

---

## About the Application 

1. The Tech Stack of this app is (Node.js, express, MongoDb, Mongoose for: Server-Side) and (HTML, Bootstrap & Pure TypeScript for: Client-Side).

2. Navigate to server directory 'cd server' , run `npm install` then run `npm start` in the server folder (btw, cors are enabled so you can run server if you want on a separate port).


### Note!
*The App is not optimized yet, so am working on this part to finish it soon!*
